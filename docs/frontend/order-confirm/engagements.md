# Payload branch "engagements"

This branch contains a lot of sub-branches, referring to several entities that CAN be attached to a cart/checkout, both by an User action (ex. "user use a coupon") or automatically (current cart composition satisfy some "cart rule" conditions); 

Basically every entity that is not described but every other branch viewed so far will be added to this branch.

::: tip GOOD NEWS!
This branch is equivalent with the same branch of the Cart/Checkout Events API!
